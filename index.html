                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <code> function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                        greetMe("World"); </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Javascript_and_Java">
                <header>Javascript and Java</header>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                <code>var x = 42. </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
                <header>Hello world</header>
                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:</p>
                <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }greetMe("World");</p>
                <code>let y = 13. </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
                <header>Constants</header>
                <p>Thou can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or
                    dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It
                    has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
